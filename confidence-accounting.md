# Confidence Accounting

Current financial accounting practices value a company with a single point value in their financial accounts. Companies that do report on social and environmental issues in demonstrating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) do so separately from financial reporting, referred to as “triple bottom line” accounting.

An innovation in financial accounting called Confidence Accounting adds range values to company financial accounts. In a changing world, confidence ranges enable the company’s "commodity value", for example, to be valued under a range of scenarios such as energy price, demographic developments, and resource access and depletion.

In parallel, producing range value information is standard practice for resource accountants and statistical agencies. The further significance of Confidence Accounting is that it readily incorporates resource accounting modifiers such as company skill sets, environmental context, and social context as part of the range. “Triple bottom line” accounting then becomes a single bottom line for decision makers to compare company value and risk in a common currency — money.

This voluntary accounting practice is for overall company valuation, while disruption of its day to day financial accounting is minimal. 

For the below hypothetical company, range values are populated with resource accounting modifiers.
