# Confidence Accounting

Current financial accounting practices value a company with a single point value in their financial accounts. Companies that do report on social and environmental issues in demonstrating corporate social responsibility do so separately from financial reporting, referred to as “triple bottom line” accounting.

An innovation in financial accounting called Confidence Accounting (CA) adds range values to company financial accounts. In a changing world, confidence ranges enable the company’s "commodity value", for example, to be valued under a range of scenarios such as energy price, demographic developments, and resource access and depletion.

In parallel, producing range value information is standard practice for resource accountants and statistical agencies. The further significance of CA is that it readily incorporates resource accounting modifiers such as company skill sets, environmental context, and social context as part of the range. “Triple bottom line” accounting then becomes a single bottom line for decision makers to compare company value and risk in a common currency — money.

This voluntary accounting practice is for overall company valuation, while disruption of its day to day financial accounting is minimal. 

For the below hypothetical company, range values are populated with resource accounting modifiers.

### Why is Confidence Accounting important for financial markets?

Attention remains on how to bring greater resilience and stability to global capital markets, including through reforms in financial accounting.

Regulators are recognizing the benefits of CA to move from "point value" to "range value" financial accounts.

Company valuation with a single point value asserts, as it did, that all investment banks’ risks are fully costed and covered, or, as it does, that all fossil fuel reserves valued in an energy company’s accounts can with full certainty be burnt, regardless of global warming risks. Neither is true.

See more detail in the publication "Confidence Accounting", a proposal from Long Finance, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), and the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment (CISI).

### Confidence Accounting example: "Is this company a going concern?"

For this example, CA answers the question “Is this company a going concern?” The finance director’s report would state that the mean value of equity at the balance sheet date is £36 billion, with a conventional minimum of £6.5 billion and a maximum of £65 billion, with 95% confidence the value of equity is at least £24 billion. The 95th percentile value, or confidence limit, is used in Confidence Accounting to support a going-concern assertion. If the state of the world doesn’t change, and the accounts are competently drawn up, the realized value of the balance sheet should be no more than £12 billion (that is, £36 billion minus £24 billion) worse than the mean.
