# Ecochefs Global

#### Capturing True Value data in small-scale food production

Ecochefs creates the enabling environment to optimize the role of small-scale rural farmers and food producers in the transition to sustainable food production, thriving food business, improved and equitable rural economies, and food and nutrition security \(FNS\).

In line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals \(MDGs\) and Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\), Ecochefs provides the data, knowledge, strategies, and tools as well as the stakeholder platform and infrastructure.

Ecochefs Global adapts existing initiatives from global partners and advisors:

– Ecochefs Maniva is an existing network of chefs and small producers centered in and around Rio de Janeiro.

– Pisces Responsible Fish Restaurants scores the quality of the catch, the environmental sustainability of fishing practices, and the fishers’ living wage, to advise in knowledge and infrastructure to bring the freshest, best-quality fish to London restaurants.

– Delicias de Alicia is a Buenos Aires Ecochefs restaurant that finances and runs workshops for children from low-income neighbourhoods to learn to cook healthy, delicious meals within their families’ budgets.

Peer pressure within the Ecochefs network drives sustainability goals and the reliability of self-evaluations. Chefs and producers are most interested in expanding their network, which provides the supply chain infrastructure to deliver quality food from producer to consumer.

As a TVI project, Ecochefs Global generates local granular data that can be used to evaluate operational performance in relation to actual global and national indicators on carbon emissions, water and land use, population health, and quality of life. All data will be standardized per unit dollar output for direct comparisons in local, regional, and national contexts.
