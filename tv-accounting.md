# How is True Value accounted?

Resource accounting + Confidence accounting = True Value accounting

Resource accounting (RA) evaluates resource use and environmental impact of local and national economies. Awareness and use of RA, particularly for carbon and water, is growing. Resource accounting can measure sustainable development on as many FIESG aspects as required.

Confidence accounting (CA) is a development already underway in financial accountancy. CA adds statistical range values to financial accounts, providing more dynamic information than current single-point value accounting.
