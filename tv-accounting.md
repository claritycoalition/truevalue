# How is True Value accounted?

Resource accounting + Confidence accounting = True Value

Awareness and use of Resource Accounting (RA), particularly for carbon and water, is growing. Resource accounting can measure sustainable development on as
many FIESG aspects as required.

Confidence Accounting is a development already underway in financial accountancy. Confidence accounting incorporates a statistical range into company accounts instead of a
single point value.
