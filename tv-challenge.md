# The Challenge

Decision makers around the world are realizing the mounting risk of "business as usual" in today's current cross-scale, complex economic systems. Behaviors in one part of the world have tremendous effect on other parts of the world. Biophysical and socioeconomic risks are inextricably linked and cannot be compartmentalized, and thus success must be global, not segmented.

As we look to 2050 and a future in which 10 billion people can live well, we must redefine our measures of economic activity to incorporate measures of environmental impact and social well-being.

The transition for 10 billion people to live well, within the limits that one planet can provide, requires that:

1. resource use and environmental impact are decoupled from GDP, and
2. GDP is aligned with human well-being.
