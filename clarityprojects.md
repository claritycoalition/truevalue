# Clarity Projects

Through its projects, Clarity brings together international partners to build the complex multi-sector relationships needed to achieve True Value economies by 2050.

Strategizing with finance and investment leaders, on the one hand, and engaging with local stakeholders and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, Clarity is building the True Value future top down and bottom up.

Stakeholder engagement is what allows Clarity projects to leverage the enabling environments needed to capture and demonstrate new data, knowledge, and True Value.

Clarity works with businesses and networks that are already making the necessary changes to effect sustainable outcomes in their own economies, building sustainability into their business models, and finding ways to scale up best-practice solutions.

Clarity's True Value data will highlight what and how these initiatives compare to "business as usual" and as such bring more relevant information and knowledge to decision makers in finance, investment, and policy.
