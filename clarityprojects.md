# Clarity Projects

Through its projects, Clarity brings together international partners to build the complex multi-sector relationships needed to achieve True Value economies by 2050.

Strategizing with finance and investment leaders, on the one hand, and with local stakeholders and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, Clarity is building the future top down and bottom up.

With its partners, Clarity projects leverage the enabling environments needed to capture and demonstrate new data, knowledge, and True Value.
