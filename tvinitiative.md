# True Value Initiative

### _Achieving True Value_

As resource use and environmental impact put pressures on economic progress and social well-being, having the data to evaluate and inform decision making for finance, investment, policy, and day-to-day living will be key to sustainable long-term returns.

On a global level, decision makers are becoming increasingly aware of the risks that “business as usual” will have on society in the decades through to 2050. A major barrier to identifying and measuring these risks — and thus addressing the **megatrends** of population growth, climate change, and resource use — is the lack of standardized, comparable data. Without this data and information, the investments that would prove most useful for creating **a future in which 10 billion people can live well** cannot be made.

In the face of this enormous challenge, the True Value Initiative aims to:

* reevaluate how value is defined, measured, and managed

* analyze and score how financial, investment, environmental, social, and governance \(FIESG\) inputs and outputs affect resource use, resource management, and long-term investment

* provide new data on how FIESG value moves through supply chains, and how FIESG value is created or depleted

* provide new data that allows for comparison among enterprises and nations on local, regional, and global FIESG issues

* direct mainstream institutional investment \(like pension funds and insurance institutions\) into investment innovations for sustainable development, including those that are viable for today’s markets.

As rapidly growing economies dramatically change resource supply/demand and global investment priorities in the decades leading to 2050, Clarity is working to bridge the information gap between current approaches in identifying resource and well-being needs and the data and infrastructure current investors require in order to invest in those needs.

Since 2012, Clarity partners have collaborated internationally to contextualize True Value measures and management into local and global economic models.

Clarity’s projects create the enabling environments required to:

1. collect, validate, and analyze FIESG data and knowledge ranging from locally sourced information to national accounts
2. use this new information to redefine the risk and reward equation for investment, including to evaluate opportunities that could not be seen as clearly or at all previously
3. apply this new information to better demonstrate steps in the path to sustainable development for business and governments
4. provide this information to the crowd — clients, customers, consumers.

Clarity’s projects fit into and support TVI by functioning as unique innovative models or platforms for the creation and demonstration of new data, knowledge, and True Value.
