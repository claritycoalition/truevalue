# True Value Semantics

#### Linking and contextualizing data to inform decision making

Semantic technology facilitates that every piece of data can be expressed in its simplest form: a triplet â€“ a representation of data points transformed into information that can be processed, linked, and analyzed by computers. Semanticizing and linking the data of various existing databases contextualizes the data, allowing it to be searched and queried to inform decision making.

Current work on this project involves semanticizing already existing public databases, such as those of the UN, OECD, FAO, and the World Bank. Making these rich stores of data accessible, especially to the public, is fundamental.

Data must be meaningful, useful, verifiable, and robust to effect true value outcomes. It is this data that will help identify the investments which best create paths to sustainable ends.
