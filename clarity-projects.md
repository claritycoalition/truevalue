# Clarity Projects

Through its projects, Clarity brings together international partners to build the complex multi-sector relationships needed to achieve True Value economies by 2050.

Strategizing with finance and investment leaders, on the one hand, and partnering with local stakeholders and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, Clarity is building the True Value future top down and bottom up.

Stakeholder engagement is what allows Clarity projects to leverage the enabling environments needed to capture and demonstrate new data, knowledge, and True Value.

Clarity works with key players who are already building sustainability into their business models and finding ways to scale up best-practice solutions. True Value data will highlight how these approaches compare to "business as usual" and thus bring more relevant information and knowledge to decision makers in investment and governance.

Clarity’s projects create the enabling environments required to:

1. collect, validate, and analyze FIESG data and knowledge ranging from locally sourced information to national accounts

2. use this new information to redefine the risk and reward equation for investment, including to evaluate opportunities that could not be seen as clearly or at all previously

3. apply this new information to better demonstrate steps to sustainable development for business and governments

4. disseminate this information to the crowd — clients, customers, consumers.
