# India's Development Alternatives

#### Pursuing sustainability versus "business as usual"

Development Alternatives \(DA\), based in New Delhi, was founded by Ashok Khosla over 30 years ago to bring business approaches to sustainable development. The Development Alternatives Group now comprises the not-for-profit flagship Society for Development Alternatives, the business-oriented incubator Technology and Action for Rural Advancement \(TARA\), and its commercial subsidiaries which include TARA Machines and Tech Services \(TMTS\), TARA Environmental Services \(TARAenviro\), TARAhaat Information and Marketing Services \(TARAhaat\), TARA Nirman Kendra \(TNK\), and DESI Power Orchha \(DESI Power\). While the focus of DA is on innovation and policy outreach, the mandate of TARA and its subsidiaries is to set up mechanisms for the large-scale delivery of goods and services essential to sustainable human development.

Adapting the semantic modeling of a data pilot for Ecochefs Global, Clarity will evaluate the true value of Development Alternatives Group. This new knowledge, compared against “business as usual”, will demonstrate the broader economic benefits of DA’s approach, and will support further business investment, policy decisions, growth, and uptake of DA technologies worldwide.
