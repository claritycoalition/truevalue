# TV Technical Framework

The technical framework is a conceptual model designed to improve the efficiency, scope, reliability, and resolution of knowledge that populates end tools such as Confidence Accounting curves, amoeba diagrams/spider charts, and other types of sustainability mapping. It is based on semantic web technologies, which standardize and globally distribute data, resources, and algorithms to identify and evaluate relationships between TV indicators.

National accounts and public data stores will provide initial data for fundamental indicators:

* **economic** — imports, exports, tax, and GDP
* **environmental** — water use, carbon equivalent footprint, primary energy use, materials use, land and sea use
* **social** — employment, income, education, and health.

All access is ultimately reduced to the APIs that are available at the various levels of the frameworks. For accessing raw or processed data, or CRUD services, or transactional services, etc., developers (in-house or third party) will use these various APIs to create clients for data mining, researchers, investors and analysts, policymakers, etc.
