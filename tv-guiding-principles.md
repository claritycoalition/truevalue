# The Guiding Principles of the True Value Initiative

### Sustainability


### Public–Private Partnerships
As the population grows to 10 billion people, government revenue (taxes) will no longer be enough to fund the infrastructure needed to sustain such population pressure. Cities, communities, and nations must find ways to build public services into private business models. 

Business and finance cannot do it all; they need government to do its part. But government can’t do it all either; it needs to respond faster, with more efficiency, to bring about widespread change in attitudes in society.

Public–private partnerships will merge their current separate trajectories into one path toward a sustainable future.

### Stakeholder Engagement
Lack of stakeholder enagement is a major criticism of currently available accounting measures of true value (see Coulson (2006) regarding KPMG's corporate framing of true value).

Value recognition is different for different people. What is critical in one culture, sector, or economy may not be so for another. This is why local stakeholder engagement is of utmost importance. Direct local collaboration will provide bottom-up information and results. Sustainability cannot be compartmentalized; it must be inclusive.

### Open Source Data and Data Accessibility
An open-source revolution is underway in how software, analytical tools, and data are created, and how researchers and developers collaborate. Researchers — notably academic researchers working on financial, environmental, and social trends — are increasingly self-assembling teams and are often ahead of the business sector in ideas within a field, without necessarily focusing on the commercial potential. 

As a result of this revolution, the prospects of even large financial institutions having the resources to develop proprietary tools or datasets that are more sophisticated, faster created, or better validated than these open-source models is increasingly implausible.

Data transparency and integrity is a priority. Open source is the way.
