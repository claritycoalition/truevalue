# Where does the data come from?

Initially, the TV technical framework (TVF) will semanticize public data stores, such as national accounts and those of the UN, FAO, OECD, and the World Bank. In total this will serve as foundational data for "business as usual", against which True Value data will be compared.

From these existing data stores, TVF will aggregate data on indicators such as:

  * economic indicators – imports, exports, tax, GDP
  * environmental indicators – water use, carbon equivalent footprint, primary energy use, materials use, land disturbance
  * social indicators – employment, income, education, health.

Second, data will be sourced locally and directly from contributing businesses and individuals (crowdsourcing). These contributors could be manufacturers, shippers, farmers, restaurants — any entity involved in commercial enterprise and throughout supply chains.
