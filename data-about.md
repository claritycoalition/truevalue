# What data?

Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz stated,

>In our performance orientated world, what we measure affects what we do. If we have poor measure, what we strive to do (say increase GDP) may actually contribute to a worsening of living standards. We may be confronted with false choices, seeing trade-offs between output and environmental protection that do not exist. By contrast, a better measure of economic performance might show that steps taken to improve the environment are good for the economy.

What the True Value Initiative is working to do is provide the data, tools, and strategies to build this “better measure of economic performance”.

For Clarity, a better measure of economic performance would include accounting for externalities, such as environmental and social impact, and risks which significantly affect resource management and decision making.

### What information are we missing? What is the “gap”?

[Clean-up and elaborate... 
The gap is the missing data on sustainable development, missing data of small and medium-sized enterprises, missing data from developing countries that neither have the resources nor the infrastructure to collect this massive data.

The missing data is the measurement of sustainable behavior that is currently not accounted for nor even considered in corporate financial accounting that only measures economic returns.

This is the information gap needed in order to direct investment into the sustainable development future.

There are two sets of data to consider:
— existing public data stores, such as national accounts and those of the UN, FAO, OECD, and the World Bank, and similar
— crowdsourced data, that is, data sourced locally and directly from contributing businesses and individuals.

#### 1. Existing public data stores (TV Semantics project)

Initially the TV technical framework (TVF) will semanticize the public data stores; this is Clarity’s TV Semantics project. This aggregated total will serve as foundational data for “business as usual”. From these existing data stores, TVF will aggregate data on indicators such as:
•	economic indicators — imports, exports, tax, GDP
•	environmental indicators — water use, carbon equivalent footprint, primary energy use, materials use, land disturbance
•	social indicators — employment, income, education, health.

It is against this existing “business as usual” data that True Value data will be compared and extrapolated.

#### 2. Crowdsourced data (TV Blockchain project)

To ensure stakeholder engagement on all levels of a supply chain, a simple 5-point scoring for “Good Green Fair” (economic, environmental, social, respectively) will be used to collect data locally and directly from contributing businesses and individuals. Scoring systems similar to GGF have already been successfully implemented to measure the sustainability of the UK fishing industry.

A critically flexible aspect of simple scoring like Good Green Fair is that it is broad enough that local stakeholders and communities can apply their own definitions/meanings and thus tailor indicators that are important for them. Local GGF can be extrapolated to economic, environmental, and social indicators of current, descriptive, “business as usual” data of existing public stores.
Because this data is crowdsourced, contributors can be manufacturers, shippers, farmers, restaurants — essentially any entity involved in commercial enterprise and throughout supply chains, including consumers and clients.

# The work ahead…

Clarity projects are currently working to model True Value for small-scale food production and corporate groups in developing countries.
