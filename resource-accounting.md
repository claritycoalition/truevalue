# Resource Accounting

Measuring the resource use and the environmental impact of economies — Resource Accounting (RA) — is growing, particularly for water and carbon. But RA can be broadened to other factors. 

If data is available, resource accounting can produce as many lines of valuation for as many environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects as required. Essentially RA provides the tools to measure sustainable development.

The Big Data revolution enables the processing of this huge data. Databases and input–output modeling have evolved to extend from individual companies and countries to connect economic and ESG information through supply chains worldwide. In theory, every invoice for every product and service could show ESG values per unit $ output at every step in a supply chain.

Such resource accounting is already in prototype use for assessing the “footprint” of individual companies and other organizations. At a national level, an example is Balancing Act, which covers 135 sectors of the Australian economy.

By providing information per unit $ output, resource information is related directly to the financial accounts of businesses and other organizations, and to traditional indicators of economic activity such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
