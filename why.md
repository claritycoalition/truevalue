# Why now?

Directing institutional investment into sustainable long-term solutions is a crucial step to overcoming the resource challenges of the decades ahead. 

Increasing consumption anticipated in China, India, and other rapidly growing economies is changing investment priorities, resource supply and demand, and risk management. 

Opportunities for global investment (which will increasingly be dominated by "ordinary savers", including through pension funds and insurance institutions) include: 

* water resources for agriculture, industry, people
* food production
* other resource access, depletion, substitution
* energy and hedging strategies for unburnable carbon
* innovation in renewable energy, information technology, business, finance, and policy strategies.

By capturing the data of sustainable best practices in these industries and sectors, True Value will highlight where investment is most needed and best utilized for long-term economic returns while also mitigating the megatrend risks leading up to 2050.
