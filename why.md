# Why is True Value important?

Increasing consumption anticipated in China, India, and other rapidly growing economies is changing investment priorities for resource allocation, supply and demand, and risk management. 

Directing institutional investment into sustainable long-term solutions is a crucial step to overcoming the resource challenges of the decades ahead. 

Opportunities for investment strategies may include water resources for agriculture, industry and people; food production; other resource access, depletion and substitution; energy and ‘hedging’ strategies for unburnable carbon; investing in innovation, changing taxation strategies, etc.

Global investment will increasingly be dominated by ‘ordinary’ savers, including through pension funds and insurance institutions acting as drivers to create a world worth living now, while also providing retirement income. Investment innovators amongst HNWI, venture capitalists and impact investors can be expected to trickle down through to mainstream investment.
