# Good Green Fair (GGF)

"Good Green Fair" is a set of sustainability indicators categorizing and equating to economic, environmental and social outputs, respectively.

### Adapted from Pisces Responsible Fish Restaurants

GGF was first used for the sustainability mapping of fish to London restaurants by Pisces RFR (responsible fish restaurants), in turn inspired by the Slow Food movement’s "Good, Clean, Fair". 

Pisces uses a simple 5-point scoring system of worst (1) to best (5):

Good 
   * the quality of the fish

Green 
   * sustainability of the stocks
   * stock status
   * selectivity of the fishing gear
   * wider environmental effects

Fair 
   * fair returns to fishermen.

For Clarity’s FNS Sub-Sahara project, Pisces inspired the design of the Ceres model to consolidate locally important good, green, and fair indicators for Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) with global indicators from national accounts, such as GHG emissions, employment, etc.
