# Sub-Sahara Food and Nutrition Security

#### Building farmers' capacities in the water–food–energy nexus

Food and Nutrition Security \(FNS\) for Sub-Saharan Africa works to scale up and adapt best-practice farming models in the water–food–energy nexus. The project builds on the Agritech Rural Development Cluster \(ARC\) model already underway or planned for six West African Countries. Innovations in the business model bring together small-scale and family farmers for training and R&D towards sustainable methods which optimize production and affordable off-the-grid energy solutions. In particular, the project looks at how value moves through Agritech’s supply chain from raw material to commodity trading in Singapore.

In support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, local data and knowledge collection and scoring assess locally important indicators such as affordable energy, water and food availability, food utilization, skill sets, family income, and comparable primary and secondary education. This local scoring is also compatible with regional and global FIESG indicators, including for better information on investment risk reward and projected economic growth. Further comparisons can be made with national and global indicators to evaluate and rank Agritech’s true value against the true value produced by its direct competitors.

In this way, Agritech investors consider TVI will highlight the Group's best practices for scaling up investment and improving entire West African economies.


### Agritech Group

William Kwende, CEO of Agritech Group, boldly states:

> The solution to the world’s food and energy crisis is to build farmers’ capacities to implement sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.

Agritech Group builds sustainability into their business model by

1. training their farmers
>> Agritech creates knowledge exchange and improves local community skill sets.

2. clustering farms to scale up innovations and strategies (called the ARC model)
>> Agritech clusters regional family farms to scale up effective water use (e.g. through fertigation, solar-powered pumps)

3. intercropping jatropha for biodiesel for both the company itself and commodity trading.
>> Biodiesel from jatropha not only reduces the region's dependence on imported petroleum for energy needs but provides direct employment to communities and increases the standard of living as affordable energy.

But in traditional financial accounts — profit and loss, cash flow and balance sheets — the monetary costs of Agritech's holistic approaches (investing in community knowledge exchange and training, soil recovery, seed storage, and intercropping) are not equated with company value in monetary terms.

Agritech's wider contribution to local, national, regional, and global economies — food and energy security, increasing family income, reducing the risk of disease, reversing desertification, and mitigating climate change — are also lost in company valuation.
