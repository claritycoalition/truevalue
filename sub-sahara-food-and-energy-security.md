#### Building farmers' capacities in the water–food–energy nexus

Food and Nutrition Security \(FNS\) for Sub-Saharan Africa works to scale up and adapt best-practice farming models in the water–food–energy nexus. The project builds on the Agritech Rural Development Cluster \(ARC\) model already underway or planned for six West African Countries.

This local scoring is also compatible with regional and global FIESG indicators, including for better information on investment risk reward and projected economic growth. Further comparisons can be made with national and global indicators to evaluate and rank Agritech’s true value against the true value produced by its direct competitors.

In this way, Agritech investors consider TVI will highlight the Group's best practices for scaling up investment and improving entire West African economies.
