# The Challenge

Decision makers around the world are realizing the mounting risk of "business as usual" in today's current cross-scale, complex economic systems. Behavior in one part of the world have tremendous effect on other parts of the world. Biophysical and socioeconomic risks are inextricably linked and cannot be compartmentalized, and thus success must be global, not segmented.



As we look to 2050 and a future in which 10 billion people can live well, we must redefine our measures of economic activity to incorporate measures of environmental impact and social well-being.
