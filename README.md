# True Value Overview

The True Value Initiative \(TVI\) is a global knowledge-to-action strategy by leading world experts from finance, investment, and sustainable development.

The objective of TVI is to provide new information on economic, environmental, and social factors to deepen understanding of how value is created, depleted, and measured. 

This new data will help bridge the information gap needed in directing institutional investment into long-term sustainable development solutions to meet the challenges of global resource trends.

Through its projects, Clarity Coalition brings together international partners to build the complex multi-sector relationships needed to achieve True Value economies by 2050.

Strategizing with finance and investment leaders, on the one hand, and engaging with local stakeholders and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, Clarity Coalition is building the True Value future top down and bottom up.
